# RivalRecon Project Requirements Document

## 1. Project Overview

RivalRecon is a competitive intelligence tool designed for CPG companies, helping them analyze product reviews from their own products as well as competitors'. The app lets users log in, submit a product URL, and then automatically scrapes reviews from shops powered by Shopify review apps (like Yotpo, TrustPilot, Loox, Judge.me) and Amazon via a Rapid API key. The tool then processes the review data with an AI (DeepSeek API) to provide insights on ratings trends, top positives and negatives, and competitive comparisons. The results are presented in a visually stunning, interactive dashboard that makes data easy to understand and action.
