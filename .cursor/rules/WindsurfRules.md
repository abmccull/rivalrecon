# RivalRecon Windsurf Rules (Copy for .windsurfrules)

This document provides a comprehensive guide for maintaining, extending, and reviewing the RivalRecon codebase. For every significant change, consult the relevant `.mdc` rule files as outlined below. This ensures consistency, security, and maintainability across the monorepo.

---

## 1. Project Structure & Organization
- **Reference:** `project_structure.mdc`
- **When:** Adding, removing, or reorganizing directories/files; onboarding new contributors; reviewing codebase organization.
- **Why:** Ensures the monorepo layout, naming conventions, and workspace separation remain clear and up to date.

## 2. Technology Stack
- **Reference:** `tech_stack_document.mdc`
- **When:** Adding new dependencies, libraries, or services; making architectural decisions; reviewing compatibility.
- **Why:** Maintains alignment with the approved stack for both frontend (`/app`) and backend (`/backend`).

## 3. Project Requirements & Scope
- **Reference:** `project_requirements_document.mdc`
- **When:** Proposing new features, changing scope, or clarifying what is in/out of scope.
- **Why:** Keeps the project focused and prevents scope creep.

## 4. Backend Development
- **Reference:** `backend_structure_document.mdc`
- **When:** Modifying backend logic, routes, services, or database models.
- **Why:** Ensures backend architecture, API design, and data models follow project standards.

## 5. Frontend Development
- **Reference:** `frontend_guidelines_document.mdc`
- **When:** Creating or updating React components, pages, or UI logic in `/app`.
- **Why:** Maintains consistency in component structure, styling, and state management.

## 6. Security & Authentication
- **References:**
  - `security_guideline_document.mdc` — For all security-related concerns (input validation, secrets, data protection, deployment)
  - `Supabase Authentication.mdc` — For implementing or modifying authentication, session management, and protected routes
- **When:** Handling user auth, sensitive data, API security, or deploying to production.
- **Why:** Protects user data and ensures compliance with best practices.

## 7. Migration & Implementation Planning
- **Reference:** `migration_implementation_plan.mdc`
- **When:** Planning or executing migrations, large refactors, or tech stack changes.
- **Why:** Provides step-by-step guidance and rationale for major transitions.

## 8. Best Practices & General Rules
- **References:**
  - `cursor_project_rules.mdc` — General best practices for code quality and maintainability
  - `cursor_rules_reference.mdc` — Quick index of all rule files and their purposes
- **When:** Unsure which rule applies, or for general development.
- **Why:** Promotes a culture of high standards and easy onboarding.

## 9. Additional Guidance
- **App Flow:** `app_flowchart.mdc` — For understanding user journeys and system flows.
- **Implementation Details:** `implementation_plan.mdc` — For architectural or planning specifics.
- **Messaging/Worker:** `CELERY_MESSAGING.mdc` — For background job and messaging concerns.
- **Repository Info:** `repository_info.mdc` — For repo-level policies and information.

## General Practices
- Always check for and update related documentation when making changes.
- If a rule needs updating, edit the relevant `.mdc` file and note the change in commit messages.
- When in doubt, consult `cursor_rules_reference.mdc` for a summary of all available rules.
- Keep the codebase DRY, modular, and consistent with the standards described in these rule files.

**Following these rules ensures RivalRecon remains clean, secure, and easy to maintain as it evolves.**
