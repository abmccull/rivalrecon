# RivalRecon Review Analysis Implementation Plan

This document outlines the steps to implement the updated DeepSeek review analysis framework with our new Supabase schema for the analyses table.

## 1. Database Schema Changes

✅ **Complete** - We've updated the `analyses` table in Supabase with the following structure:

```sql
-- Core fields for analysis results
id                       uuid (primary key)
submission_id            uuid (foreign key to submissions table)
review_count             integer
average_rating           numeric
sentiment_score          double precision

-- Sentiment data
sentiment_distribution   jsonb
rating_distribution      jsonb

-- Keywords and topics
keywords                 jsonb
product_features         jsonb
word_map                 jsonb (legacy)
key_themes               array (legacy)

-- Insights and opportunities
key_insights             jsonb
improvement_opportunities jsonb
opportunities            jsonb (legacy)
top_positives            jsonb
top_negatives            jsonb
competitive_insights     jsonb (legacy)

-- Time-based data
ratings_over_time        jsonb
trending                 text (legacy)

-- Representative reviews
review_text_sample       jsonb

-- Metadata
created_at               timestamp
updated_at               timestamp
```

## 2. DeepSeek Prompt Enhancements

✅ **Complete** - Modified the DeepSeek prompt in `app/services/deepseekService.js` to:

- Request specific data structures matching our schema
- Provide detailed instructions for each type of analysis
- Include comments and examples for each expected field
- Improve the system prompt for more comprehensive analysis
- Increase max tokens from 2000 to 4000 to handle larger response

## 3. Integration in Worker Service

✅ **Complete** - Updated `app/worker/tasks.py` to:

- Calculate review_count and average_rating directly from reviews data
- Map all new DeepSeek response fields to Supabase table columns
- Maintain backward compatibility with legacy fields
- Add updated_at timestamp to track analysis refreshes

## 4. Implementation Rollout Plan

### Phase 1: Development & Testing

1. **Local Testing** (1-2 days)
   - [ ] Set up test environment with DeepSeek API key
   - [ ] Create test datasets with varied review types
   - [ ] Run analysis on multiple test cases
   - [ ] Validate JSON structure of responses
   - [ ] Verify proper data insertion into Supabase

2. **Integration Testing** (1-2 days)
   - [ ] Test full pipeline from submission creation to analysis
   - [ ] Validate app (Next.js frontend) dashboard rendering with new data structure
   - [ ] Check error handling and fallbacks
   - [ ] Ensure backward compatibility with existing analyses

### Phase 2: Deployment

3. **Staged Rollout** (1 day)
   - [ ] Deploy backend code changes to staging environment
   - [ ] Run analyses on real-world data
   - [ ] Monitor and resolve any issues
   - [ ] Compare analysis quality with previous version

4. **Production Deployment** (1 day)
   - [ ] Deploy code to production
   - [ ] Monitor system performance and API response times
   - [ ] Track DeepSeek API costs and token usage
   - [ ] Create monitoring alerts for analysis failures

### Phase 3: Optimization & Enhancement

5. **Performance Optimization** (Ongoing)
   - [ ] Optimize DeepSeek prompts based on response quality
   - [ ] Fine-tune JSON structure for storage efficiency
   - [ ] Implement caching for frequent analysis patterns
   - [ ] Set up automatic re-analysis of high-priority submissions

6. **Documentation & Training** (1 day)
   - [ ] Update API documentation
   - [ ] Document the new data structure and fields
   - [ ] Create usage examples for app (Next.js frontend) developers
   - [ ] Document troubleshooting processes

## 5. Monitoring & Maintenance Plan

1. **Quality Monitoring**
   - [ ] Set up regular review of analysis quality (weekly)
   - [ ] Compare DeepSeek insights with human analysis on key samples
   - [ ] Track sentiment accuracy against other tools

2. **Performance Monitoring**
   - [ ] Track average analysis time per review batch
   - [ ] Monitor DeepSeek API response times and failures
   - [ ] Set up alerts for analysis task queue backlog

3. **Cost Tracking**
   - [ ] Monitor token usage and associated costs
   - [ ] Implement usage limits based on subscription tier
   - [ ] Optimize prompts for token efficiency

## 6. Future Enhancements

1. **Analysis Improvements**
   - [ ] Add competitor identification and comparison
   - [ ] Implement multi-language support
   - [ ] Add trend prediction based on historical data

2. **Infrastructure Improvements**
   - [ ] Implement batch analysis for large review sets
   - [ ] Add real-time analysis capabilities for streaming reviews
   - [ ] Develop fallback to alternative models if DeepSeek is unavailable
