# RivalRecon Implementation Plan

This document outlines the next steps and a high-level implementation plan for RivalRecon with a focus on secure design, robust architecture, and adherence to best coding practices.

---

## 1. System Architecture Overview

- **Frontend:**
  - Framework: React.js
  - UI Library: Chakra UI
  - Animations: Framer Motion
  - Data Visualization: Plotly.js, react-wordcloud
  - Routing: React Router
  - Security Notes:
    - Use HTTPS endpoints exclusively
    - Implement secure storage for authentication tokens
    - Enforce CSP and other security headers
    - Ensure mobile-responsive design

- **Backend:**
  - Framework: Node.js with Express
  - Background Jobs: Celery and Redis
  - API Integrations: Scrapy (for Shopify scraping), Puppeteer (for scraping review platforms), Rapid API (for Amazon scraping), DeepSeek API (for AI analysis)
  - Security Considerations:
    - Validate and sanitize all incoming data
    - Use parameterized queries and ORMs with Supabase (PostgreSQL)
    - Manage secrets using environment variables or secured secret manager (avoid hardcoding)
    - Enforce rate limiting and throttling to protect endpoints

- **Authentication & Authorization:**
  - Tool: Clerk
  - Implementation:
    - Enforce robust authentication and session management
    - Implement secure session-scoped tokens and cookie security (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite)
    - Validate roles and privileges on every API call

- **Payment Processing:**
  - Provider: Stripe
  - Use secure webhooks and encryption for sensitive data handling

- **Deployment and Infrastructure:**
  - Frontend: Deployed using Vercel
  - Backend: Railway
  - Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL) with secure connections enforced
  - All connections use TLS 1.2+ and up-to-date cipher suites

---

## 2. Core Features & Milestones

### 2.1 User Management & Subscription

- **User Roles:**
  - Single user profile for MVP
  - Enforce analysis limits based on subscription plan (Free, $19.99, $49.99 tiers)
- **Security Measures:**
  - Secure session management with Clerkâ€™s authentication
  - RBAC enforced on protected endpoints

### 2.2 Data Scraping & Processing

- **Scraping Components:**
  - Shopify Scrapy integration for product reviews
  - Puppeteer-based scraping for Yotpo, TrustPilot, Loox, Judge.me
  - Rapid API integration for Amazon reviews
  - Input Validation:
    - Sanitize URLs and user inputs
    - Validate scraped content before processing
- **Error Handling:"
  - Provide user-friendly error messages upon failures
  - Log errors securely without exposing stack traces to users

### 2.3 AI Analysis Integration

- **DeepSeek API:**
  - Send valid, sanitized data for analysis
  - Default settings used initially
  - Handle API errors gracefully and provide corrective actions in the UI

### 2.4 Dashboard & Reporting

- **Visualizations:**
  - Dashboard will include a variety of charts: Pie, Line, Bar, Radar, Scatter, Heatmap, Gauge, and Word Cloud
  - Use Plotly.js and react-wordcloud for dynamic charting
  - Ensure output encoding and safe data rendering to prevent XSS
- **Export Options:**
  - PDF and CSV download for analysis results

---

## 3. UI/UX & Branding

- **Brand Guidelines:**
  - Color Palette: Deep Blue, Teal, Pale Blue, Dark Gray
  - Typography: Inter Font
  - Logo: Clean and modern design reflecting competitive intelligence
- **Design Tokens:**
  - Use Chakra UI theming for consistency

---

## 4. Security and Privacy Considerations

- **Data Protection:**
  - Encrypt sensitive data in transit (TLS 1.2+) and at rest (AES-256 for storage)
- **Secrets Management:**
  - Use environment variables or a dedicated secrets management solution
- **API Security:**
  - Validate and sanitize all inputs
  - Use rate limiting on API endpoints
  - Implement secure error handling (fail securely without leaking internal system data)
- **Session Management:**
  - Secure cookie settings (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite) and regular session timeout enforcement

---

## 5. Infrastructure and DevOps

- **Server Hardening:**
  - Disable unnecessary services and minimize exposed ports
  - Keep dependencies updated with vulnerability scanning (using SCA tools and lockfiles)
- **Deployment Security:**
  - Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines configured with security checks
  - Debug features disabled in production

---

## 6. Next Steps & Task Breakdown

### 6.1 Planning and Setup

- Set up project repositories with strict access controls
- Configure CI/CD pipelines with built-in security scanning
- Define environment configurations with secure defaults (TLS, database credentials, etc.)

### 6.2 Frontend Development

- Scaffold React project and integrate Chakra UI, React Router
- Develop components for input forms, dashboard visualizations, and export options
- Implement secure token handling and local input sanitization

### 6.3 Backend Development

- Scaffold Express server with secure middleware (helmet, rate-limiters, CORS settings)
- Integrate scraping tools with robust error handling and input validation
- Develop endpoints for AI analysis requests, subscription management, and dashboard data retrieval
- Secure database access with parameterized queries and ORM capabilities

### 6.4 Testing & QA

- Unit tests, integration tests, and penetration tests
- Validate all input handling, session management, and output encoding
- Perform vulnerability scans on dependencies and static code analysis

### 6.5 Deployment & Monitoring

- Deploy frontend to Vercel, backend to Railway; ensure HTTPS is enforced
- Monitor application performance and error logs (initially minimal analytics for MVP)
- Plan for future integration of comprehensive analytics/monitoring

---

## 7. Summary

This implementation plan for RivalRecon adheres to secure design principles and best practices:

- Secure defaults and robust authentication & authorization
- Rigorous input validation and secure communication between components
- Compliance with security principles such as Least Privilege, Defense in Depth, and Fail Securely

The development will progressively incorporate additional features and security enhancements as the project evolves, ensuring that even the MVP is built with a strong security posture from day one.
